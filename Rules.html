Crime & Government Employees</span>Government employees are strictly prohibited from engaging in any illegal activities or possessing illegal items, unless it is necessary for the execution of their job duties. This is subject to the judgment of a staff member. Before beginning their role within the government, employees are required to ensure that they no longer possess any illegal items.
                <br><br>
                The following organizations are subject to this rule:
                <ul>
                    <li>Police Force</li>
                    <li>Royal Netherlands Marechaussee</li>
                    <li>Ministry of Justice</li>
                    <li>Government</li>
                </ul>
                If a government employee is caught engaging in illegal activities, in addition to the standard penalty, they will face immediate dismissal from the relevant organization.
                <br><br>
                It is prohibited to possess items that originate from a government service, including but not limited to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Service weapons</li>
                </ul>
                Government employees are not allowed to carry their service weapons outside of duty, if applicable. An exception is made for police officers who have undergone specialized training. These officers are permitted to carry their service weapons outside of duty for the purpose of executing their work.
            </li>
        </ul>
